# TechDegree-PROJECT-1 RENEWED
I created a random Quote generator in play with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that generates a random quotes.

FEATURES:
.This project has a page that holds an array of objects(each with quotes), and the objects' properties holds
  different part of the quotes(e.g: source of the quote, the year etc).
.I created functions(getRandomQuote & printQuote), the former retrieves a random quote from the quotes array and
  & the latter prints(shows) the quote on the page with all its attributes.
.Gave it a button that when clicked a different quote is shown and a timer that does the same after every 10sec.
.I also gave the page a random backgroundColor: a different color is shown each time the page refreshes.
